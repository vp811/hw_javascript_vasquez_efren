# MMC6278 Homework - JavaScript

The purpose of this assignment was to test us on our knowledge of JavaScript's arrays, objects, and functions.

## GitHub Repo
* [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/vp811/hw_javascript_vasquez_efren.git)

## Resources

1. [Variable Functions](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/662)
	* I had issues with part 6c. I used this site to fix an error I was receiving in my code "display is already declared in the upper scope". After reading this issue I was able to fix the problem by turning display into a variable.
2. [Array Push](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_push.asp)
	* I did not remember how to ad to an object to an array so I found this information online. It was pretty simple to understand.

## Deductions

* I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus

## Comments

* I had the most trouble with part 6c because I kept receiving error messages either in the console or on Atom. I hope the way I did it is correct and if it is not I look forward to seeing the correct solution.
